Genome Analysis of Oxytetracycline Production in Streptomyces rimosus
=====================================================================

Project Overview
----------------

Welcome to the Genome Analysis project focused on uncovering the genetic mechanisms underlying oxytetracycline production in Streptomyces rimosus. The objective of the project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the S. rimosus genome to gain insights into the pathways and regulatory elements involved in antibiotic hyperproduction.

Objectives
-----------

1. Genome Assembly:
   - Perform de novo assembly of long Nanopore sequencing reads.
   - Refine the assembly using short Illumina reads to improve accuracy and completeness.

2. Transcriptomics and Differential Expression Analysis:
   - Conduct transcriptomic analysis to compare gene expression profiles between the hyperproducer S. rimosus strain and the wild-type strain.
   - Perform differential expression analysis to identify genes and pathways associated with antibiotic hyperproduction.

3. Genome Annotation and Synteny Evaluation:
   - Annotate the assembled genome to identify protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs, and other functional elements.
   - Evaluate synteny with the wild-type genome to assess structural conservation and identify genomic variations.

4. Candidate Gene Identification:
   - Identify candidate genes and pathways potentially involved in oxytetracycline biosynthesis and regulation.

5. Documentation:
   - Document findings, methodologies, and analysis workflows for future reference and reproducibility.
